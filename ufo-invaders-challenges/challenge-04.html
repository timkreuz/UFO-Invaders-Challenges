            Now it's time for the UFO to start targeting some small animals. And it's going to
            do that using it's evil Neutronium Abduction Beam. Also known as the NAB.
        </strong>

        Starting Branch: cc03-complex
        Solution Branch: cc04-abduction

        The UFO will pause for three seconds. Think of that as 3000 milliseconds. Then the NAB
        will instantaneously appear. And it will take 3000 milliseconds for the abduction to
        occur. After which the UFO will again fly around randomly.

        Why are we pausing for 3000 milliseconds? Because later we want the humans a chance to
        set up their anti-NAB shield. But that's later.

        In order for this to happen we will need to set up a few things.

        First, the UFO is going to need different action modes. Flying, Pre-Abduction,
        Abduction and Post-Abduction.

        Second, we'll need some kind of timer for each of those action modes. And since the ufo
        already has a timer, we're actually all set.

        Third, the NAB should be its own object - not just an extension of the UFO. That way
        different ojects can interact with the NAB and the UFO separately if we need to. So for
        the NAB, think long skinny rectangle. And drawing that is already set up. But we might
        make it more complex if we want to show the abductee getting transported up.

        Fourth, we need some random trigger to start the abduction. We can do this when we
        update the UFO. Same place where we randomize direction, we can randomize when an
        abduction will start.

        This is going to be challenging but we can break this down into a bunch of small problems.

        <strong>
            Goal #1: Set up the Action Modes.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <hr>

    <div class="directions">
        Step 1 - Mode

        In ufo.js give the ufo a mode attribute with a value of "flying" for starters.
        Something like this is fine:
    </div>

    <div class="codeblock">
        <code>
            mode: "flying"
        </code>
    </div>

    <div class="directions">
        Step 2 - Updating Randomize to Change Modes.

        Here's the modes:
        flying - that's what we're already doing
        pre-abduction - stop flying.
        abduction - activate the NAB.
        post-abduction - de-activate the NAB

        To start an abduction, we can generate a random number. For example: 1-1000. And then if that
        number is less than some other number, for example 200, then we can start the abduction. But
        we only want to do that if the UFO is flying.

        Don't we already have a randomize function somewhere? Yes.

        Perfect. Every time the timer ends we call randomize. When we get there, we know that the
        timer for something came to an end. But the timer for what? So we need some if statements to
        check the mode. And then for each mode we decide what the next action will be and for how long.

        Try coding that up before checking the solution.


        Step #3 - Updating the Updates

        Right now out updates are used to change the position of the UFO based on the speed of
        the UFO. But that only happens when we're flying. So put an if block around that code.

        We'll come back later and add updates for the other modes. You can add some if blocks for the
        other modes now if you want. And just leave them empty.

        Now we can test this out. And what should happen is that every once in a while, the UFO
        stops moving for about 6 seconds and then starts flying around randomly again.

        <strong>
            Goal #3 - The NAB.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <hr>

    <div class="directions">
        In order for the NAB to work, several things need to be set up.
        1 - We need a beam.js.
        2 - Each UFO needs to know about it's own NAB. So it can turn it on and off and update it.
        3 - The game needs to know about all of the NABs.
        4 - Draw needs to get the NABs from the game and draw them.

        For Goal #3 - We focus only on the NAB.

        Step 1 - Create the beam.

        Create a beam.js and it will have three functions to export:
        getBeam(), updateBeam(), turnOffBeam().

        Step 2 - getBeam

        Make the beam complex. That way we can have two parts. The beam itself. And then we can
        draw the abductee on top of the beam and change its position as it moves up.

        When we first get the beam, we really don't want to draw it. So we need something to tell
        the draw function not to draw it. So add a display property with a value of false.
    </div>

    <div class="codeblock">
        <code>
            display: false,
        </code>
    </div>

    <div class="directions">
        And since we're not displaying it yet, we really don't care about x, y, height and width
        Just give them any value for now. Same for parts. Just give it an empty array for starters.
        Now when the beam turns on, then we need to figure all that out. But that's not this functions
        job. This function just needs to give the ufo and beam object back.

        Step 2 - turnOffBeam

        We'll do this function next because it's super easy. When this function gets called, it will
        take a beam object in, and set display = false. That's it. That's the signal to the draw
        function not to draw it.

        Step 3 - updateBeam

        This will also turn it on. The ufo object will get passed in. Which will have a reference
        to the beam. And this will be the hard part. We need to figure out x, y, width, height and
        get the parts. Just like the ufo, we can have a function called get parts. Other than copying
        the code from the solution, there's really no easy way other than do the work and figure this
        out. So give it a try and see how far you can get.

            Goal #4 - The UFO and the NAB.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <hr>

    <div class="directions">
        Just a few details for the UFO to get the NAB working.

        First, when we create the ufo, create an attribute called beam and call getBeam()
        to assign its value.

        Second, during post-abduction, call the turnBeamOff function.

        Third, during abduction, call the updateBeam function.

        During pre-abduction, we really don't want to do anything. Just wait. So that part
        is easy.

            Goal #5 - Update the Game.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <hr>

    <div class="directions">
        The game should have a list of beams. Just like it has a list of ufos.
        All we need is a function that will loop over the ufos and add their beams
        to an array and return it.
    </div>

    <p>
        <strong>
            Goal #6 - Update Draw.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <hr>

    <div class="directions">
        Two things are needed here.

        First, just like we draw the ufos, we can draw the beams.

        Second, we need to check for that display property. There's two options.

        Option 1 - Give every object a display property. If the value is true, draw it. If the
        value is false, skip drawing it.

        Option 2 - If the object doesn't have a display property, then assume it wants to be
        drawn and go ahead and draw it. The if statement is a little trickier but then we don't
        have to udpate all the other objects with display: true.

        The solution went with Option 1.

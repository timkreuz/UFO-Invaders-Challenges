          Wow - Those abductions look really scary. Let's get started on the defense system!
        </strong>

        Starting Branch: cc04-abduction
        Solution Branch: cc05-defense

        This starter defense system won't actually do anything to protect anybody, including
        the cats and chickens.  But it will fly above the surface of the earth and will serve
        as the foundation for all our other defense mechanisms. 

        The amazing thing we get to work with here will be Keyboard Events Handlers!  
        
        That's right. When we hit the right arrow key, the defense system will move to the right. Unless 
        of course it reaches the edge of the screen in which case the defense system will do absolutely 
        nothing.  And similar logic will exist for the left arrow key.

            Goal #1: Create a defense System.

        Here's a hint.  Start with a defense.js.  
        
        And draw an object on the screen.  Make it look however you want.

            Goal #2: Add the Event Handlers.

    <div class="directions">
        Unlike the first goal, this will be a great place too copy some code.  

        Step 1 - Create a new controller called events.js.

        Step 2 - Copy and paste this code into the file.

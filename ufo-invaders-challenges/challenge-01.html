                UFO Invaders!
            </strong>
            In the past it was only crazies on the fringe who believed in aliens and their occasional 
            abductions of humans and animals.  
            
            But lately the aliens have become more bold and their abductions of cats and chickens is 
            believed by just about everybody.  But now fresh evidence shows that they plan to colonize 
            and take over the whole planet.

            It's our job to develop a defense system and strategies to protect our planet. We'll
            need a shield, some missiles and a new technology - exploding chickens.

            Since this game is called UFO Invaders, lets start by creating the evil UFO.
        </strong>

        Starting Branch: cc00-starters
        Solution Branch: cc01-ufo

        Here's the overall plan:

        1. We'll create a ufo object, just like we already have the sky and earth.

        2. We'll give it some speed values. And create an update function that we can
        use to make it fly.

        3. Since it just flies off the screen, we'll give it some boundaries telling
        it how far it's allowed to go up, down, left and right. We'll then use
        those to make it change directions and stay on the screen.

        4. Because ufos don't fly around in nice predictable patterns, we'll randomize
        its movement.

            Goal #1: Draw a UFO in the Sky.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <hr>

    <div class="directions">
        This first UFO is going to be a simple rectangle. That's really boring but
        for now we just want to get the mechanics working. Later we can replace that
        with an image or something more complex.

        Step 1 - Create a new file called ufo.js in the objects folder.

        Step 2 - Create an object called ufo. Just look at earth.js or sky.js as examples.
        Place it up in the upper left somewhere.

        Step 3 - On main.js import getUFO. Again the same as we do for the earth and sky.

        Step 4 - Create a drawUFO function. Just like... You got the idea.

        Step 5 - Call the drawUFO function.

        Step 6 - Display your page and make sure you can see the UFO. It should be
        sitting up in the sky do nothing except looking around for cats chickens.

            Goal #2: Make the UFO Move.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <hr>

    <div class="directions">
        Now things are going to get exciting. At least for about 3-4 seconds.

        Step 1 - Update our ufo and give it two new attributes:
        speedX will tell us how fast it moves from left to right. Start that out at 2.
        speedY will tell us how fast is moves up and down. Start that out at 2 also.

        Step 2 - Add a new function to ufo.js to update the ufo.

        Step 3 - In that new function add speed to the ufo's x position.

        Step 4 - Import that function on main.js just like we immported getUFO.

        Step 5 - Call that new function from our draw function.
        Update first. Then draw.

    <div class="codeblock">
        <code>
            export function updateUFO(ufo) {
                ufo.x = ufo.x + ufo.speedX;
            }

            import {getUFO, updateUFO} from './objects/ufo.js'; 

            updateUFO(ufo);
        </code>
    </div>

    <div class="directions">
        Display your page. Watch the UFO fly away!!!
        Wow. Breathtaking wasn't it.

            Goal #3: Get the UFO to stay on the screen.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <hr>

    <div class="directions">
        Bad UFO! Stay! 

        Step 1 - Update our ufo and give it four new attributes:
        maxLeft, maxRight, maxUp and maxDown.  Give those some values that make sense.
    </div>

    <div class="codeblock">
        <code>
            export function getUFO(canvas) {
            
            maxLeft: ?, maxRight: canvas.?,
            maxUp: ?, maxDown: canvas.height /?,
        </code>
    </div>

    <div class="directions">
        Step 2 - In the udpate function, ff the UFO hits the right sides of the screen, 
        have it reverse back the other way.
    </div>

    <div class="codeblock">
        <code>
            if (ufo.x + ufo.width > ufo.maxRight) {
                ufo.speedX = ufo.speedX * -1;
            }
        </code>
    </div>

    <div class="directions">
        Refresh your game and make sure that works.
        Code a little. Test a little.

        Step 3 - Now do the same for the left and top and bottom.

            Goal #4: Still too boring. Aliens aren't that predictable.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <hr>

    <div class="directions">
        This part will be a bit more challenging. But let's make the UFO fly around randomly 
        and change directions and speed every 2-5 seconds. Becausebanyone who knows anything 
        about UFOs knows they don't fly around in nice predictable patterns.

        2-5 seconds in javascript is 2000-5000 milliseconds.

        Step 1 - Update your UFO and give it a new attribute called timer.  This means do 
        whatever it is you're doing for 3 seconds.  Then we'll mix thins up.
    </div>

    <div class="codeblock">
        <code>
            timer: Date.now() + 3000
        </code>
    </div>

    <div class="directions">
        Step 2 - Create a new function call randomize.
        It will take ufo as input.  And for now it won't do anything.
    </div>

    <div class="codeblock">
        <code>
            function randomize(ufo) {
            }   
        </code>
    </div>

    <div class="directions">
        Step 3 - Now in our update function we'll call randomize every time the timer is done.
    </div>

    <div class="codeblock">
        <code>
            if (Date.now() > ufo.timer) {
                randomize(ufo);
            }
        </code>
    </div>

    <div class="directions">
        Step 4 - Now let's randomize the ufo.
        All we need to do is change the speeds and set a new timer.

        For the speeds generate a random number 0-90.  Then subtracted 45 to get a
        random number between -45 and 45.  Then I divided by 10 to get random speeds
        from -4.5 to 4.5.  That might be too fast, but for now it's good.

        For the timer we get random numbers between 0 and 1000.  Then add 2000. So 
        that's 2000-3000 milliseconds.  Or 2-3 seconds.
    </div>

    <div class="codeblock">
        <code>
            function randomize(ufo) {
                ufo.speedX = (Math.floor(Math.random()* 90) - 45)/10;
                ufo.speedY = (Math.floor(Math.random()* 90) - 45)/10;
                ufo.timer = Date.now() + Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) + 2000;
            }
        </code>
    </div>

    <div class="directions">
        Nice! It's still a boring rectangle, but that's the way real UFOs fly around right?

            Goal #1: Draw a UFO in the Sky.

    <div class="directions">
        This first UFO is going to be a simple rectangle. That's really boring but
        for now we just want to get the mechanics working. Later we can replace that
        with an image or something more complex.

        Step 1 - Create a new file called ufo.js in the objects folder.

        Step 2 - Create a map to represent our ufo. You can look at earth.js or sky.js as examples.
    </div>
    <div class="codeblock">
        <code>
            export function getUFO(canvas) {
                return {
                    type: "rectangle",
                    x: ?, y: ?, width: ?, height: ?,
                    color: '#ffff33'
                };
            }
        </code>
    </div>
    <div class="directions">
        Step 3 - Make changes to main.js to draw it.

        Add the imports.
        Create a variable called ufo.
        Create the draw function.
        And what else is needed to make it work?
    </div>
    <div class="codeblock">
        <code>
            import {getUFO} from './objects/ufo.js'; 
            
            var ufo = getUFO(canvas);
            
            function drawUFO(ufo) {
                ???
            }

            ???
        </code>
    </div>
    <div class="directions">
        Display your page and make sure you can see the UFO. It should be
        sitting up in the sky do nothing except looking around for cats chickens.

            Goal #2: Make the UFO Move.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <hr>

    <div class="directions">
        Now things are going to get exciting. At least for a couple of seconds.

        Step 1 - Update our ufo and give it two new attributes:
        - speedX will tell us how fast it moves from left to right. Start that out at 2.
        - speedY will tell us how fast is moves up and down. Start that out at 2 also.

        Step 2 - Add a new function to ufo.js to update the ufo.
    </div>
    <div class="codeblock">
        <code>
        export function updateUFO(ufo) {
            ufo.x = ????;
        }
            </code>
    </div>
    <div class="directions">
        Step 3 - Import that function on main.js

        Step 4 - Call that new function from our draw function.
        Update first.
        Then draw.

        Display your page. Watch the UFO fly away!!!

            Goal #3: The UFO decides to stick around.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <hr>

    <div class="directions">
        Let's see if we can get the UFO to stay around a little longer.

        Step 1 - Update our ufo and give it four new attributes:
        maxLeft, maxRight, maxUp and maxDown.
        Hints: Having the canvas will help.
    </div>

    <div class="codeblock">
        <code>
            export function getUFO(canvas) {
            
            maxLeft: ?, maxRight: canvas.?,
            maxUp: ?, maxDown: canvas.height /?,
        </code>
    </div>

    <div class="directions">
        Step 2 - If the UFO hits the right sides of the screen, have it reverse
        back the other way.
    </div>

    <div class="codeblock">
        <code>
            if (ufo.x + ufo.width > ufo.maxRight) {
                ufo.speedX = ufo.speedX * -1;
            }

            Goal #6: Still too boring. Aliens aren't that predictable.
        </strong>
    </p>

    <div class="directions">
        This part will be a bit more challenging. But let's make the UFO fly
        around randomly and change directions and speed every 2-5 seconds. Because
        anyone who knows anything about UFOs knows they don't fly around in nice
        predictable patterns.

        2-5 seconds in javascript is 2000-5000 milliseconds.

        Step 1 - Update your UFO and give it a new attribute called timer.
    </div>


    <div class="codeblock">
        <code>
            timer: Date.now() + 5000
        </code>
    </div>

    <div class="directions">
        Step 2 - Create a new function call randomize.
        It will take ufo as input.
        And for now it won't do anything.
    </div>

    <div class="codeblock">
        <code>
            function randomize(ufo) {
            }   
        </code>
    </div>

    <div class="directions">
        Step 3 - Now in our update function we'll call randomize every time the timer is done.
    </div>

    <div class="codeblock">
        <code>
            if (Date.now() > ufo.timer) {
                randomize(ufo);
            }
        </code>
    </div>

    <div class="directions">
        Step 4 - Now let's randomize the ufo.
        All we need to do is change the speeds and set a new timer.

        This might look weird, but it's just 3 lines of code. And since lots of random
        things might be happening in th game, it's a good idea let this sink in a little.

        Anyway, now we have an example of how it's done.
    </div>

    <div class="codeblock">
        <code>
            // Speeds will be between -4.5 and 4.5
            ufo.speedX = (Math.floor(Math.random()* 90) - 45)/10;
            ufo.speedY = (Math.floor(Math.random()* 90) - 45)/10;

            // Timer will be between 2 and 3 seconds in the future.
            ufo.timer = Date.now() + Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) + 2000;
        </code>
    </div>

    <div class="directions">
        Nice! It's still a boring rectangle, but that's the way real UFOs fly around right?

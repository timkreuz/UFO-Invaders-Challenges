            Now that we have the evil UFO flying around, it might be nice to have it start
            abducting some of those cats and chickens. But first, there's some small problems
            to fix.
        </strong>

        Starting Branch: cc00-ufo
        Solution Branch: cc01-enhance

        The first problem is we're going to be drawing a lot more objects - like abduction
        beams, and defense systems and missiles and shields and alien invaders. And that's
        going be a lot of ctx begin, draw, fill, etc... There's got to be a better way.

        The second problem is all we can draw right now are boring rectangles. What if
        we want to draw an ellipse, or a more complex object or display a cool image.
        So we'll fix that too.

        And third, we need to think about the overall strategy to this game before it gets 
        too complex.  

        And there's probably a couple of other little things to fix.

        Hopefull this won't be too painful.  A few baby steps and some copy paste we can 
        get this done.

            Goal #1: Improve the UFO Change Direction Code.
        </strong>

    <div class="directions">
        Whether you hit the left of right side of the wall, you always change directions by
        multiplying the speed by -1. Let's add an 'or' statement to that code using '||'.
    </div>
    <div class="codeblock">
        <code>
            if ((ufo.x + ufo.width > ufo.maxRight) || (ufo.x < ufo.maxLeft)) {
                ufo.speedX = ufo.speedX * -1;
            }
        </code>
    </div>
    <div class="directions">
        Now do the same for the up and down direction changes.

        Make sure everything is still working.

        Create a drawObject function.

        </code>
    </div>
    <div class="directions">
        Now figure out what you can get rid of.
        And there's something that needs to change.

        Make sure your code still works.

            Goal #3 - Now Overall Strategy.
        </strong>
    </p>

    <div class="directions">
        This thing is going to get complex as we start adding more and more. And complex
        problems don't need complex solutions.  They need simple ones.

        We'll have an object called game.  It will contain all the objects we're trying to
        manage.  Right now earth, sky, ufo, stats.  Later, there will be defense systems, aliens, 
        missiles, abduction beams, cats, exploding chickens... And it will contain the stats 
        and something to tell us the game is over and few other details we need.

        Then we'll have a function to update the game.

        And another function to draw the game.

        And later we'll have a function to get events.  But that's later.

        So for now we'll just do this. 
            Is the game over?  No.  Then Update and Draw.
            Is the game over?  No.  Then Update and Draw.
            Is the game over?  No.  Then update and Draw.
            Is the game over?  No.  Then update and Draw.

        You get the idea.  And we'll just do that over and over hundreds and thousands of 
        times until either we destroy the aliens or they destroy us.  At which point the 
        game will be over and we'll can stop updating and drawing.

        And that's a really simple strategy. 

        So let's get this all set up.

        Step 1 - Create a folder.  Call it control.

        Step 2 - Create 3 files there: game.js, update.js, draw.js

        Step 3 - Inside game.js write some code to set up the game.  This will be a 
        good place to use your copy/paste skills.
        </draw>
    </div>

    <div class="codeblock">
        <code>
            import {getEarth} from '../objects/earth.js';
            import {getSky} from '../objects/sky.js'; 
            import {getUFO} from '../objects/ufo.js'; 
            import {getStats} from '../objects/stats.js'; 
            
            export function getGame() {
                var stats = getStats();
                var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
                var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
                var infoCenter = document.getElementById("infoCenter");
                var infoCtx = infoCenter.getContext("2d");
                var earth = getEarth(canvas);
                var sky = getSky(canvas);
                var ufo = getUFO(canvas);
            
                var game = {gameOver: false,
                            infoCenter: infoCenter, infoCtx: infoCtx,
                            canvas: canvas, ctx: ctx,
                            stats: stats,
                            earth: earth, sky: sky, ufo: ufo};
                return game;
            }
        </code>
    </div>

    <div class="directions">
        And if you notice.  That's a bunch of stuff we already have in main.js.  But we 
        can leave it all there in main.js for now.

        Step 4 - Inside update.js let's do our update.
    </div>

    <div class="codeblock">
        <code>
            import {updateUFO} from '../objects/ufo.js'; 

            export function updateGame(game) {
               //missing code. hint: it updates something.
            }
        </code>
    </div>

    <div class="directions">
        Step 5 - Inside draw.js let's do our drawing.  Another good time to use copy/paste. 
        There's going to be plenty of chances to do more coding here later.    
    </div>

    <div class="codeblock">
        <code>
            export function drawGame(game) {
                displayScore(game);
                drawObjects(game);
            }
            
            function displayScore(game) {
                console.log(game);
                game.infoCtx.clearRect(0, 0, game.infoCenter.width, game.infoCenter.height);
                game.infoCtx.fillStyle = "#ffffff";
                game.infoCtx.fillText("Score: " + game.stats.score + "          Abductions: " + game.stats.abductions +
                    "          Aliens Landed: " + game.stats.visitors, 8, 20);
            }
            
            function drawObjects(game) {
                game.ctx.clearRect(0, 0, game.canvas.width, game.canvas.height);
                drawObject(game.ctx, game.earth);
                drawObject(game.ctx, game.sky);
                drawObject(game.ctx, game.ufo);
            }
            
            function drawObject(ctx, object) {
                ctx.beginPath();
                ctx.rect(object.x, object.y, object.width, object.height);
                ctx.fillStyle = object.color;
                ctx.fill();
                ctx.closePath();
            }
        </code>
    </div>

    <div class="directions">
        Step 6 - Now let's clean up main.js. Be ready to be amazed.  

        You can delete all the stuff we moved out of here.  
        
        And because we're doing way more than drawing, rename draw to runGame. 
        
        And then you should end of with code that looks like this.... 
    </div>

    <div class="codeblock">
        <code>
            import {getGame} from './controllers/game.js';
            import {drawGame} from './controllers/draw.js';
            import {updateGame} from './controllers/update.js';
            
            //add one line of code to get the game
            
            function runGame() {
                if (?????) {
                    //exactly one one line of code here.
                } else {
                    //Exactly two lines of code are missing here.
                }
            }
            
            //Exactly one line of code here.
        </code>
    </div>

    <div class="directions">
       Check that out.  There's hardly anthing left in main.js.  In fact, looking at that code, 
       we don't have any idea what kind of game this thing is running.  It could be about ufos
       and aliens. Or it could be rainbows and unicorns and fighting jellyfish.  It doesn't know
       or care.
       
       So just with what we have here, you have what it takes to start creating your own game.
